# Onyx
Onyx is a framework providing a way to handle Discord application commmands, message components, and interactions.

*Onyx is currently in development - features may be added or modified at any time.*

# Usage
>**Key note:** *Onyx does not provide any way to automatically receive data.* <br>
What this means is that you will have to manually obtain and dispatch an event to a method within Onyx. This can be done using the gateway events, or any other custom solution via websockets, as long as Onyx is given the proper data.

Futher usage is to be defined.
