# Onyx
Onyx is a framework providing a way to handle Discord application commands, message components, and interactions.

*Onyx is currently in development - features may be added or modified at any time.*

# Usage
>**Key note:** *Onyx does not provide any way to automatically receive data.* <br>
What this means is that you will have to manually obtain and dispatch an event to a method within Onyx. This can be done using gateway interaction events, or any other custom solution via Websockets, as long as Onyx is given the proper interaction data. <br>
<br>
Likewise, Onyx does not do anything to validate data to ensure it meets proper limits (such as character limits) at this time.

Further usage is to be defined.
